# PIgrade
This is a project where i remake linux and put it on a raspberry pi pico, thats right, no handholding either, thats not how i do things here, linux will be reprogrammed from the ground up to provide a fast and surprisingly good OS experience, im making this for the people who cant afford a proprer raspberry pi :D
