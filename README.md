#PIgrade
this is in no way affiliated with the "pigrade-pro" repo thingy

developement starts in march

it can only display information using screens if:
 you have an OLED screen thats compatible, 
 youre willing to make an RCA circuit to output to your tv, 
 you can use your phone as a screen

this is a repository about bringing more functionallity to the Raspberry PI Pico

how will i do that??
SIMPLE
I WILL REPROGRAM ALL OF LINUX
well, not ALL of it, but rather program a small shell and a very small kernel to create a fake linux enviroment

although this is mainly focused on linux, i will also remake MS-DOS
why?
cause i LOVE ms-dos, and its very easy to make for a raspberry pi

this project will also work on arduino with small tweaks
