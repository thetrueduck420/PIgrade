#PIgrade
this is in no way affiliated with the "pigrade-pro" repo thingy

developement started in 25.02.2025

it can only display information using screens if:
 you have an OLED screen thats compatible, 
 youre willing to make an RCA circuit to output to your tv, 
 you can use your phone as a screen

this is a repository about bringing more functionallity to the Raspberry PI Pico

how will i do that??
SIMPLE
I WILL REPROGRAM ALL OF LINUX
well, not ALL of it, but rather program a small shell and a very small kernel to create a fake linux enviroment

although this is mainly focused on linux, i will also remake MS-DOS
why?
cause i LOVE ms-dos, and its very easy to make for a raspberry pi

this project will also work on arduino with small tweaks

this will have its own filesystem, if you have no sd card, not to worry, BetterFS lite (which comes in the no-sd version) stores files inside ram, but be aware, this isnt persistent storage, it dies off after a reboot

this isnt THAT optimized, but im one teenager, i literally cant handle this much
i need to make a BASIC interpreter, a 2 filesystems (betterfs,and betterfs lite), my own assembly language, an assembler, and a way to compile basic cause its fun

i guess i didnt mention im making that stuff, but yea, im working on it

i promise its still gonna be good

im also using TINYSCRIPT (TS) to make an EVAL function in order to make commands easier

and if no one uses it, at least i can, which is enough for me i guess
