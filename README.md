this is in no way affiliated with the "pigrade-pro" repo thingy
i dont even know what pigrade pro is
no offense of course, it seems pretty cool

developement started in 25.02.2025

it can only display information using screens if:
 you have an OLED screen thats compatible, or
 you can use your phone as a screen

but its recommended to just use the serial monitor provided by the Arduino IDE

this is a repository about bringing more functionallity to the Raspberry PI Pico

how will i do that??
SIMPLE
I WILL REPROGRAM ALL OF LINUX
well, not ALL of it, but rather program a small shell and a very small kernel to create a fake linux enviroment

although this is mainly focused on linux, i will also remake MS-DOS
why?
cause i LOVE ms-dos

this project will also work on arduino

this will use BETTERFS, provided by the HexaBoot bootloader (you can find the repo on my account)

this isnt THAT optimized, but im one teenager,i need to make a BASIC interpreter my own assembly language, an assembler, and a way to compile basic cause its fun

i guess i didnt mention im making that stuff, but yea, im working on it

i promise its still gonna be good

and if no one uses it, at least i can, which is enough for me i guess

its pretty much meant for putting linux on small things or using as a CPU that comes with linux
for example, i plan to gut a broken phone, replace the screen and replace its insides with the pico


in order to add it to HexaBoot, you must follow some instructions, but theyre in the code as comments

i might also work on real time task processing, but i dont know

so, sit tight, and lets make an operating system!
on a side note, my stomach hurts
it doesnt matter, i just wanted to say it

anyways, this is coming out soon enough
im getting very close to a demo

current status: im remaking the whole OS, along with HexaBoot, this is for optimization and ease of use, its not gonna take long
